<h3>&#x2022; The first person to make the periodic table of elements was Dmitri Mendeleev.</h3></h3>
<h3>&#x2022; It first appeared in his book ‘The Principles of Chemistry’ in 1869.While writing this book, he tried to classify the elements according to chemical properties and found patterns in this statistic that led to the way he organised his table. 

</h3>
<h3>&#x2022;In March 1869, he made a formal presentation about his periodic table to the Russian Chemical Society, in which he described elements according to valence and atomic weight</h3>
<h3>&#x2022;Mendeleev's periodic table exhibited similar properties at regular intervals when arranged in atoms weights, which allowed Mendeleev to predict the existence of undiscovered elements.
<h3>&#x2022;Mendeleev's first periodic table validated the belief of atoms, which, in the late 1800s, was very controversial. 
<h3>&#x2022;Mendeleev's first periodic table helped him predict the properties of undiscovered elements. This was done by looking at the physical and chemical properties of a metal next to a gap.

<p>Similarities between macroscopic properties in each of the chemical families, revealed by Mendeleev's periodic table, led to expectations of microscopic similarities additionally. 
<p>For example, atoms in sodium should be similar to atoms in other alkali metals. 
<p> This could relate chemical reactivities for these elements and could explain analogous compounds.
<p> Mendeleev's periodic table revealed the periodic law, which states that: when elements are listed in order of increasing atomic weights, their properties will periodically vary.

<p>The structure of the first periodic table by Mendeleev was:</p>

<h3>&#x2022;It was a vertical chart.</h3>
<h3>&#x2022;It organised the 63 known elements by atomic weight.
<h3>&#x2022;It placed elements with similar properties into horizontal rows.
