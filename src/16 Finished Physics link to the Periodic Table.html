<h2>Physics link: Isotopes:</h2>
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/hydrogen-isotopes-1140x640.png" height="320" width="570"></body>

<p>Isotopes have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons.</p>

<p>There are stable isotopes that do not emit radiation. There are also unstable isotopes that do emit radiation, these are radioisotopes.</o>

<p>Isotopes can form naturally or spontaneously by radioactive decay of the nucleus, for example by:</p>
<h3>&#X2022;Beta particles (which require a lot of protection).
<h3>&#X2022;Alpha particles (which require a very small distance).
<h3>&#X2022;Photons (which require a lot of shielding).
<h3>&#X2022;Neutron radiation (which requires the most significant shielding since it is considered most dangerous and severe to humans because of its high kinetic energy).
<h3>&#X2022;Isotopes have the same number of protons, different number of neutrons.


<p> Isotopes can also form artificially by bombarding a stable nucleus with charged particles through the use of a neutrons or an accelerator in a nuclear reactor.


<hgroup>
<h2>Physics link: Alpha particles</h2>
</hgroup>

<p>As radioisotopes naturally decay, particles lose or deposit energy onto materials (e.g., water, air, people) as it passes through it. In this situation, alpha particles energy is deposited across short distance ; is therefore more easily stopped. 
<p>Alpha particles = form of nuclear radiation with a large positive charge.</p>

<h3>How alpha particles are produced</h3>

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha particles are produced by alpha decay. In alpha decay, alpha particles are emitted from the nuclei of heavy radioactive elements. 
<h3>&#X2022;Usually radionuclides emit particles from their nuclei to become more stable, transforming the original element to a new element. (Radionuclides are unstable radioactive elements.)


<hgroup>
<h3>Alpha particles: Rutherford's technique (How their existence was proven)</h3>
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://us.123rf.com/450wm/dkn0049/dkn00492111/dkn0049211100147/177693813-rutherford-technique-gold-foil-experiment.jpg" height="450" weight="320"></body>

<h3>&#X2022;Rutherford's experiment proved that alpha particles are mostly empty space. This is because in the experiment, the alpha particles went straight through the gold foil.
<h3>&#X2022;Moreover, Rutherford's experiment also proved that there is a concentration of posiitive charge in alpha particles. This is because in Rutherford's experiment, a small number of alpha particles were deflected at large angles. Like charges repel, opposite charges attract. Therefore, in the experiment, positive alpha charges were repelled by positive charges.
<h3>&#X2022;Additionally, in Rutherford's experiment, a very small number of particles came straight back. This suggests that the mass and positive charge are concentrated in the nucleus. (The nucleus is a tiny volume of the atom.)
<p>In conclusion, Rutherford's experiment showed the existence of a nuclear atom, the alpha particle. (The alpha particle is a small, positively-charged nucleus, surrounded by empty space, then it has a layer of electrons to form the external part of an atom.)

<hgroup>
<h3>Extra facs about alpha particles:</h3>
</hgroup>

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha radiation= when alpha rays are emitted. This happens when the nucleus of an atom becomes unstable and alpha particles are emitted in order to restore balance. When the nucleus of an atom is unstable, the ratio of neutrons to protons is to low.

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha particles expend most of their energy immediately after emission, despite being highly energetic, ergo, they usually do not travel more than a mere few inches.

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha particles are the slowest and the heaviest, they tend to have speeds of 12,400 miles per second.

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha radiation has a positive charge of two.

<h3>&#X2022;The charge and high mass of an alpha particle, comparative to other nuclear radiation forms, give it a poor ability to penetrate matter and greater ionization power.

<h3>&#X2022;Alpha rays consist of two neutrons and two protons that are bound together into a particle, which is identical to helium-4.


<p>Alpha particle tend to dissipate their energy during collisions by two amin mechanisms: electron excitation and ionization. 
<p>Electron excitation occurs when an alpha particle cannot impart sufficient energy to an atomic electron for the alpha particles to be ejected from the atom. The atoms/molecules of a material absorb a bit of the alpha-particle energy and become elevated to a higher state of energy.
<p>Ionization by collision in alpha particles occurs when directly ionizing alpha particles are electrically charged particles that have sufficient kinetic energy to ionize. 
<p>Alpha particles can be considered directly ionizing because they carry a charge. Ergo, they can interact directly with atomic electrons with coulombic forces (such as: like charges that repel each other, opposite charges attract each other). </p>

<h2>The Photoelectric Effect</h2
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://i0.wp.com/thescienceandmathszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1042-2.jpg?fit=2402%2C1205&ssl=1" height="340" width="750"></body>

<h4>&#X2022;The photoelectric effect= the emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation (e.g., light) hits a material.
<h4>&#X2022;Electrons emitted in this way are named photoelectrons.
<h4>&#X2022;Electrons are dislodged only when light exceeds a particular frequency, this is regardless of the duration of exposure or the intensity of the light. Ergo, a low-frequency beam does not build up enough energy needed to produce photoelectrons.
<h4>&#X202;Photons of a light beam have photon energy. This is proportional to the light’s frequency.
<h4>&#X2022;In the process of photoemission, when an electron in a material absorbs more energy than its binding energy, it is quite likely to be ejected.
<h4>&#X2022;The electron is unable to escape the material, if the photon energy is too low.

<body><img src="https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/53246803/5bf0aad1ea688bf7672177a9a76f9e_gallery.jpeg" height="540" width="540"></body>

<p>Photoemission is most readily observed on metals and other conductors, although it is possible using any material. This is because the process produces a charge imbalance, which results in an increasing potential barrier until emission completely stops. 
<p>This can be prevented if the current flow neutralises the charge imbalance. 
<p>Since metals can conduct electricity and current, metals and other conductors are used for observations of photoemission. 
<p>The energy barrier to photoemission can normally be increased by nonconductive oxide layers on metal surfaces. 
<p>With observing photoemissions, vacuums (provided by vacuum tubes) can be useful because it prevents gases from impeding the flow between electrodes. </p>

<h3>Photons</h3>
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/photonpar.jpg" height="420" width="540"></body>

<h4>&#X2022;Photons= miniscule particles that comprise of waves of electromagnetic radiation.
<h4>&#X2022;Photons, as currently proven by Maxwell, are just electric fields travelling through space.
<h4>&#X2022;Photons have no resting mass, travel at the speed of light and have no charge.
<h4>&#X2022;Photons can be emitted by radioactive decay, the action of charged particles, or other methods.
<h4>&#X2022;Photons contain energy that cannot be divided. This energy is stored as an oscillating electric field, these fields can oscillate at nearly any frequency. 
<h4>&#X2022;Photons cannot be observed by the human eye. A photon will correspond to light of a given colour, therefore, if multiple photons act in unison, the human eye can see a given colour if multiple photons act on it.

<h3>Berkelium</h3>
</hgroup>
<p>Atomic number 97 = Atomic number 97 is Berkelium (Bk).
<p>It is a radioactive element and is a part of the transuranium and actinide elements series.
<p>All elements in these element series are produced in accelerators, nuclear reactors or explosions of nuclear weapons and they all have many isotopes that emit alpha rays.
<p>Berkelium was named after the University of California at Berkely ; is one of two elements in the periodic table named after a university.

<h3>Feynmanium</h3>
</hgroup>

<h4>&#X2022;The element with atomic number 137 is untriseptium, it can be called Feynmanium (Fy). 
<p>A scientist called Feynman showed that in an atom with 137 protons, electrons would be moving faster than the speed of light. 
<p>Since going faster than the speed of light is considered impossible, Feynman concluded that there cannot be elements with atomic numbers above 137.
<p>(Feynman was an American theoretical physicist.)</p>

<h3>Oganesson</h3>
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/93/128693-050-7BCBAC9B/properties-element-part-imagemap-Periodic-Table-of.jpg" height="420" width="640"></body>

<h4>&#X2022;The element with one of the highest atomic mass and atomic number of all known elements is Oganesson (Og), it has the atomic number 118. 
<h4>&#X2022;Oganesson was discovered in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.
<h4>&#X2022;Oganesson is very unstable. 
<h4>&#X2022;It is a member of the noble gases (group 18), however, despite this, it could be significantly reactive. An example of this is the fact that it was once predicted to be a gas under regular condition. However, now, due to relativistic effects, it is predicted to be a solid.

<h2>Heavy Atomic Nuclei</h2>
</hgroup>

<body><img src="https://images.nagwa.com/figures/explainers/435134816408/10.svg" height="209" width="494"></body>

<h4>&#X2022;The more unequal two nuclei are in terms of mass, the more the possibility is that the two nuclei will react. 
<h4>&#X2022;The heaviest atomic nuclei are made in nuclear reactions that combine two other nuclei of unequal size into one. 
<h4>&#X2022;Heavier nuclei are usually made in neutron-rich environments such as supernovae or the merger of two neutron stars. Under neutron-rich environments, nuclei capture neutrons rapidly to produce heavier nuclei. 
<h4>&#X2022;Material made of heavier nuclei is made into a target, then is bombarded by a beam of lighter nuclei. 
<h4>&#X2022;Nuclei are usually all positively charged, therefore, they usually will repel each other because of electrostatic repulsion. 

<p>Two nuclei can fuse if they approach each other closely enough. The strong interaction of two nuclei nucleus. 
<p>They could overcome this repulsion. However, only if in bounds a very short distance from the nuclei can make this happen.
<p>Beam nuclei are greatly accelerated to make this repulsion insignificant compared to velocity of the beam nucleus.</p>

<p>Only coming close is not enough for two nuclei to fuse. 
<p>When two nuclei approach each other, they normally remain together for 10(-20) seconds and then part ways, instead of forming a single nucleus.
<p> When they part ways, they will not necessarily go back to the same composition as before the reaction. </p>

<p>If the two nuclei fuse, the temporary merger is termed a compound nucleus and is in an excited state. 
<p>To reach a more stable state, the compound nucleus needs to lose its excitation energy. To do this it will either eject or fission one or several neutrons. 
<p>These will carry away energy. This usually happens 10(-16) seconds after the original collision.

<h4>&#X2022;Then the beam passes through the target and reaches the separator (the next chamber), if a new nucleus was produced, it was carried with the beam. 
<h4>&#X2022;Then the newly produced nucleus, in the separator, is separated from other nucleotides and transferred to the surface-barrier detector. 
<h4>&#X2022;This stops the nucleus. The transfer takes around 10(-6) seconds, the nucleus must survive this long in order to be detected.

<p>The strong interaction determines the stability of the nucleus. 
<p>Its range is very short, however, because as nuclei get larger, its influence on the most external nucleons (neutrons, protons) weakens.</P>

<p>So far, nuclei of the heaviest elements has been observed to mainly decay by decay modes caused by such repulsion as: spontaneous fission and alpha decay. 
<p>Alpha decay is registered by emitted alpha particles. Decay products can be determined before the actual decay, if a decay or series of consecutive decays produces a known nucleus, the initial product of a reaction can be determined.
<p>However, spontaneous fission produces various nuclei as products, so the initial nuclide can’t be determined by its products/daughters.</p>
