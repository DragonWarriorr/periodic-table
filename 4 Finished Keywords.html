<section>
<h2>The Age of Enlightenment</h2>
<article>
<p>Period of rigorous philosophical, scientific and political advances, it is also called the Age of Reason.
<p>It was also an intellectual and philosophical movement, it mainly happened in the 18th century.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Atomic Theory</h2>
<article>
<p>Theory that matter consists of discrete units named atoms. (All atoms of an element have identical properties and mass, compounds are formed of a compound of 2 or more varieties of atoms.) An rearrangement of atoms is a chemical reaction. 
<p>According to Dalton’s atomic theory, different types of atoms can be distinguished by their atomic weight.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Science Revolution</h2>
<article>
<p>Period of drastic change in scientific thought, mainly occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2>
<article>
<p>Transition from making things manually to using machines, happened around 1760 to 1840.
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Spectrum Analysis</h2>
<article>
<p>Calculations of oscillations/waves in a set of sequenced data. The spectrum that the name refers to is intensity vs wavelength or frequency and was first used in 1860.
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Valence</h2>
<article>
<p>Electrons involved in/available in a chemical bond formation.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Atomic weight</h2>
<p>Total weight of an atom.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Philosopher's Stone</h2>
<article>
<p>An object that can turn an ordinary metal into gold.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Nuclei</h2>
<article>
<p>Positively charged central core of an atom, consisting of neutrons and protons, which contain almost all of its mass.
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Neutron</h2>
<article>
<p>Subatomic particle of around same mass as a proton, has no electric charge, is present in all atomic nuclei except hydrogen.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Electronegativity</h2>
<article>
<p>Tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself, is affected by atomic nuclei and the distance that its valence electrons are from the charged nuclei.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Electron affinity</h2>
<article>
<p>Energy change that was produced by adding an electron to a gaseous form.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Ionization energy</h2>
<article>
<p>Quantity of energy that is isolated, gaseous atom in the ground electronic state must absorb to discharge an electron. This results in a cation.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Oxidation state</h2>
<article>
<p>Hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to different atoms were fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation/loss of electrons of an atom in a chemical compound.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Quantum mechanics</h2>
<article>
<p>Provides a description of physical properties in nature at the scale of subatomic particles and atoms. In quantum mechanics, momentum, energy, angular momentum and other qualities of a bound system are restricted to quantization(discrete values)</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Old quantum theory</h2>
<article>
<h4>&#X2022;Quantum mechanics arose because of theories to explain scientific observations that could not be explained by classical physics. 
<h4>&#X2022;For example, the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper (that explained the photoelectric effect). 
<h4>&#X2022;Another example of this is Max Planck’s solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem. 

<p>This is what became known as old quantum theory, the early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena. 
<p>This is what led to the larger development of quantum mechanics in the mid 1920s.</p>

</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Manhattan Project</h2>
<article>
<p>Development and research undertaking during World War Two, which produced the first ever nuclear weapons.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Analogous compounds</h2>
<article>
<p>Elements in the same column within periodic table will have same/similar properties as each other. 
<p>When a molecule has 1 element replaced with another element from the same column, the 2 columns are called analogous.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Relativistic effects</h2>
<article>
<p>Discrepancies between values calculated by models that consider relativity and those that do not.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Velocity</h2>
<article>
<p>The speed of something in each direction.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Momentum</h2>
<article>
<p>Quantity of motion of a moving body, measured as a product of velocity and mass.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Angular momentum</h2>
<article>
<p>Quantity of rotation of a body, product of angular velocity and inertia.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Angular velocity</h2>
<article>
<p>Rate of change of angular position of a rotating body.</p>
</article>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Inertia</h2>
<article>
<p>If a body is at rest, it will stay at rest until it is acted on by a force. 
<p>On the other hand, if a body is travelling at a constant speed in a straight line, it will continue moving like this unless it is acted on by a force.</p>
